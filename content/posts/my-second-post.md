# Welcome to My Blog

Hello, and welcome to my second blog post!

## What's This About?

In this post, I'm exploring how to create a blog post using Hugo and Markdown.

### Creating Content

Hugo allows you to write content in Markdown, which is an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format that converts to structurally valid HTML.

#### Why Markdown?

- **Simplicity**: It's straightforward, with no need for complex HTML or CSS.
- **Readability**: It's designed to be as readable as possible.
- **Control**: It allows me to control the formatting of my document.

### Code Example

Hugo also supports code snippets:

```scala
println("Hello, Hugo!")
